      Statement of Policies
  </h2>
  <p>
      Northwest University Police Officers enforce violations of Missouri’s general motor vehicle laws and University traffic policies that occur on campus property.
  </p>
  <p>
      A Northwest Missouri State University parking permit is required to park on campus. The purchase and display of a valid parking permit does not guarantee a specific parking space. It is the sole responsibility of the vehicle driver to locate a valid parking space. These regulations are applicable to all members of the University community, which shall include, but is not limited to, students, faculty, staff, visitors, and vendors.
  </p>
  <p>
      Traffic and Parking enforcement is conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.
  </p>
  
    A. General
    <p> 
  1.  A vehicle is defined as a motorized means of transportation that is licensed by the state (if applicable) and must adhere to all state and campus regulations.
Anyone who utilizes University parking facilities, including but not limited to, faculty, staff, students and visitors must have a current Northwest parking permit visible and properly displayed and shall be responsible for the registered vehicle and any citation(s) issued to that vehicle.
</p>
<p>
2. The University shall assume no liability or responsibility for any vehicle parked on campus property and Motorcycles and scooters are subject to the regulation governing motor vehicles.

</p>
<p>
3. The owner of a disabled vehicle located in a parking lot shall notify the University Police Office within 30 minutes of the disability or the vehicle is subject to be towed and/or ticketed at the owner’s expense. The owner of a disabled vehicle parked improperly shall be responsible for moving the vehicle within 24 hours. A disabled vehicle on the roadway must be moved as soon as a wrecker or other appropriate means can be employed.
